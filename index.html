        <h1>Welcome to the WiV Virtual Assistant Throwdown
        </h1>
        <h2> Our Test</h2>
        <p>Can your favorite voice assistant count by 2s or add two items to your shopping list at once? <a href="https://www.speechtechmag.com/Articles/Editorial/Industry-Voices/Does-Your-Intelligent-Assistant-Really-Understand-You-143235.aspx">We tested the core capabilities of several major VAs </a> and got some pretty hilarious responses like </p>

        <p> Q: Count to 10 by twos</p>
        <p>A: How long should the timer be?</p>
        <p>  or</p>

        <p>Q: Is it Tuesday or Wednesday</p>
        <p>  A: No, Wednesday is not Tuesday. Tuesday is on July 21, 2020.</p>


        <p> Not the most helpful response if you’ve lost track of the days while sequestered at home. We asked 189 questions of 5 major VAs and found surprisingly poor results, even on very simple questions. That was a bit sad but the testing was so fun that we wanted to get more people involved! Our test questions and the assessment guidelines are available at the Github repository <a href="https://github.com/Virtual-Assistant-Tech">Virtual Assistant-Tech</a> and we want to invite Women in Voice to look at what we’ve done and use it as a jumping off point to probe YOUR favorite “smart” assistant AND WIN PRIZES.</p>
