        <h1>Welcome to the Digital Assistant Throwdown
        </h1>
        <h2> Our Test</h2>
        <p>Can your favorite voice assistant count by 2s or add two items to your shopping list at once? <a href="https://www.speechtechmag.com/Articles/Editorial/Industry-Voices/Does-Your-Intelligent-Assistant-Really-Understand-You-143235.aspx">We tested the core capabilities of several major VAs </a> and got some pretty hilarious responses like </p>

        <p> Q: Count to 10 by twos</p>
        <p>A: How long should the timer be?</p>
        <p>  or</p>

        <p>Q: Is it Tuesday or Wednesday</p>
        <p>  A: No, Wednesday is not Tuesday. Tuesday is on July 21, 2020.</p>


        <p> Not the most helpful response if you’ve lost track of the days while sequestered at home. We asked 189 questions of 5 major VAs and found surprisingly poor results, even on very simple questions. That was a bit sad but the testing was so fun that we wanted to get more people involved! Our test questions and the assessment guidelines are available at the Github repository <a href="https://github.com/Virtual-Assistant-Tech">Virtual Assistant-Tech.</a>  We want to continue looking at what we’ve done and use it as a jumping off point to probe YOUR favorite “smart” assistant.</p>
        <h2> Join us!</h2>
        <p> We plan to have a monthly get-together to try things out and see how the assistants do. Sign up on <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/digital-assistant-throwdown-tickets-130717177597">Eventbrite.</a></p>

        <p>Everyone is welcome, whether you’ve done any advance exploration or not--we think it will be especially fun for people to be able to test live during our conversation, so keep your favorite smart speaker or phone app version of same handy. </p> 
        <p> We also are collecting a corpus of interesting and challenging questions for virtual assistants. You can send anything you'd like to contribute to <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/virtual-assistant-tech"> this Google Group</a> and we'll add it to the Github corpus.</p>

        <p> Contributions should be:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reasonable (i.e. a virtual assistant could reasonably expected to answer them)</li>
            <li>Free from speech recognition errors</li>
            <li>In good taste</li>
            <li>Verifiable (which means they have to be in English-sorry!)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Format for submission:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Q:
            </li>
            <li>A:</li>
            <li>Comments: for example, any relevant contextual information such as the previous utterance.</li>
            <li>Assistant name:</li>
        </ol>
